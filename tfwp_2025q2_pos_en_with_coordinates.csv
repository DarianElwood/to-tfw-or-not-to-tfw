"2. This list excludes all personal names, such as employers of caregivers or business names that use or include personal names. For this reason, the list is not complete and does not reflect all employers who requested or received an LMIA. Should an employer wish to contact ESDC concerning the accuracy of their information, please contact NA-TFWP-PTET@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca.",,,,,,,,,,
"3. The employer name is manually entered in the system. As such, accuracy of the names is subject to potential data entry error and inconsistent spelling.",,,,,,,,,,
"4. Effective September 2024, NOC 2021 is being used. All occupations under NOC 2011 prior to September 2024 had been converted to the respective NOC 2021 occupations. Empirical concordance released by Statistics Canada  was used to determine appropriate linkages.",,,,,,,,,,
"5. As of the publication of Q4 2023 data (published in April 2024), all LMIAs in support of 'Permanent Residence (PR) Only' are included in TFWP statistics, unless indicated otherwise. All quarterly data in this report includes PR Only LMIAs. Dual-intent LMIAs and corresponding positions are included under their respective TFWP stream (e.g., low-wage, high-wage, etc.) This may impact program reporting over time.",,,,,,,,,,
"6. The LMIA System tracks TFW positions only, not TFWs who are issued a work permit or who enter Canada. Not all positions approved result in a work permit or a TFW entering Canada. For information on the number of work permits issued, please consult Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada's (IRCC) Facts and Figures: http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/statistics/menu-fact.asp",,,,,,,,,,
